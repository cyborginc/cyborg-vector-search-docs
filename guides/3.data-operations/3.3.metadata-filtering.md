# Filtering Queries with Metadata

CyborgDB supports metadata tagging and filtering, enabling fine-grained search filters in addition to encrypted vector search. Metadata, like vectors, are [end-to-end encrypted](../5.security-details/5.1.security-overview.md) and never exposed in plaintext outside of the client.

## Supported Metadata

The following metadata types are supported:

- Boolean
- String
- List of strings
- Numbers (will be stored as fp64)

> [!NOTE]
> Metadata filtering is only supported for `IVFFlat` and `IVFPQ` index types; not for `IVF`.

## Adding Items with Metadata

To add items with metadata tags, you can pass a dictionary of key-value pairs to the `metadata` field during `upsert`:

```python
# Example data in the format:
# [{id: str, vector: List[float], metadata: Dict)]
data = [
    {"id": "item_1", "vector": [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1], "metadata": {"category": "dog"}},
    {"id": "item_2", "vector": [0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2], "metadata": {"category": "cat"}}
]

# Upsert data with metadata
index.upsert(data)
```

This metadata will be encrypted and stored in the index.

## Filtering Queries with Metadata

CyborgDB supports a subset of [MongoDB's Query and Projection Operators](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/). For more details, see [Metadata Query Operators](#metadata-query-operators)

To filter a query with metadata, you can pass a dictionary of filters to the `filters` field during `query`:

```python
# Example query
query_vector = [0.5, 0.9, 0.2, 0.7]
top_k = 10

# Example filters
filters = {
    "category": {"$in": ["dog", "cat"]} # Will match either 'dog' or 'cat'
}

# Perform query
results = index.query(query_vector=query_vector, top_k=top_k, filters=filters)
```

## Metadata Indexing

All metadata fields are indexed using encrypted indexing. This allows CyborgDB to securely exclude clusters which don't match the provided metadata filters. As a result, searches with metadata filter should be as fast or faster than those without.

## Metadata Query Operators

CyborgDB supports a subset of [MongoDB's Query and Projection Operators](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/). Specifically, the following operators are supported:

|  Filter   |             Types             | Description                                                                     |
| :-------: | :---------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$exists` |             `any`             | Matches vectors that have this field                                            |
|   `$eq`   | `Boolean`, `Number`, `String` | Matches vectors with the metadata that is equal to the filter value             |
|   `$ne`   | `Boolean`, `Number`, `String` | Matches vectors with the metadata that is not equal to the filter value         |
|   `$in`   |      `Number`, `String`       | Matches vectors with metadata that is in the filter array                       |
|  `$nin`   |      `Number`, `String`       | Matches vectors with metadata that is not in the filter array                   |
|   `$gt`   |           `Number`            | Matches vectors with metadata that is greater than the filter value             |
|  `$gte`   |           `Number`            | Matches vectors with metadata that is greater than or equal to the filter value |
|   `$lt`   |           `Number`            | Matches vectors with metadata that is less than the filter value                |
|  `$lte`   |           `Number`            | Matches vectors with metadata that is less than or equal to the filter value    |
