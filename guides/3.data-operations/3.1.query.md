# Querying an Encrypted Index

Once you've added data to an encrypted index, you can query it:

```python
import cyborgdb

# Set index location and config location beforehand...
client = cyborgdb.Client(index_location=index_location, config_location=config_location)

# Load index
index_name = "my_index" # Index name (must exist)
index_key = b'...' # Replace with your index key
index = client.load_index(index_name=index_name, index_key=index_key)

# Example query
query_vector = [0.5, 0.9, 0.2, 0.7]
top_k = 10

# Perform query
results = index.query(query_vector=query_vector, top_k=top_k)

print(results)
# Example results (IDs and distances)
# [("id": "item_12", "distance": 0.01), ("id": "item_7", "distance": 0.04), ...]
```

For implementation details of `query`, review our API docs [here](../../reference/python/py-api.md#query) (or for C++, [here](../../reference/cpp/cpp-api.md#query)).

## Query Parameters

Encrypted queries expose a number of parameters to tune performance as desired:

- **`query_vector` or `query_vectors`**: vector or vectors to use for nearest-neighbor search. See [Batched Queries](#batched-queries) to learn more about `query_vectors`.
- **`query_contents`**: query contents to be embedded. See [Automatic Embedding Generation](#automatic-embedding-generation) for more details.
- **`top_k`**: maximum number of nearest neighbors to return. Defaults to `100`.
- **`n_probes`**: number of lists (clusters) to probe in search. Defaults to `1`. See [Configuring Index Types](../2.encrypted-indexes/2.3.configuring-encrypted-index.md#configuring-an-encrypted-index) for details about lists. Higher `n_probes` will yield greater recall but longer query times.
- **`greedy`**: whether to perform greedy search (higher recall with same `n_probes` at the cost of some speed).
- **`include`**: fields to include in query results. Can include `distances`, `metadata` and `vector`. `id` will always be included.
- **`filters`**: metadata filters to apply before vectors search. See [Metadata Filtering](./3.3.metadata-filtering.md) for more details.

## Batched Queries

Queries can be batched by passing a list of vectors to the `query` call via `query_vectors`:

```python
# Example queries
query_vector = [
    [0.5, 0.9, 0.2, 0.7],
    [0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]
]
top_k = 10

# Perform query
results = index.query(query_vectors=query_vectors, top_k=top_k)

print(results)
# Example results (IDs and distances, for each query)
# [
#   [("id": "item_12", "distance": 0.01), ("id": "item_7", "distance": 0.04), ...], # Query #1
#   [("id": "item_3", "distance": 0.02), ("id": "item_16", "distance": 0.12), ...]  # Query #2
# ]
```

## Retrieving Items Post-Query

In certain applications, such as RAG, it may be desirable to retrieve matching items after a query. This is possible via `get_item`, which retrieves and decrypts items (if they were added in `upsert`):

```python
# Example query
query_vector = [0.5, 0.9, 0.2, 0.7]
top_k = 10

# Perform query
results = index.query(query_vector=query_vector, top_k=top_k)

# Extract the item IDs from the query
result_ids = [res["id"] for res in results]

# Retrieve the items from the query results
items = index.get(result_ids)

# Alternatively, retrieve only the top match
item = index.get([results[0]["id"]])
```

For implementation details of `get`, review our API docs [here](../../reference/python/py-api.md#get) (or for C++, [here](../../reference/cpp/cpp-api.md#get)).

## Automatic Embedding Generation

If your encrypted index was set up with [automatic embedding generation](../2.encrypted-indexes/2.1.creating-encrypted-index.md#automatic-embedding-generation), you don't need to provide a `query_vector` on `query()` calls. Instead, you can provide a text/image (depending on the embedding model selected) via the `query_contents` field:

```python
from PIL import Image

# Perform query via text
results = index.query(query_contents="What is the capital of Paris?", top_k=top_k)

# Perform query via Image
results = index.query(query_contents=Image.open("image.png"), top_k=top_k)
```

## Query Performance

> [!TIP]
> For the [embedded lib](../0.overview/0.1.deployment-models.md) version of CyborgDB, queries will initially default to 'untrained' queries, which use an exhaustive search algorithm. This is fine for small datasets, but once you have more than `50,000` vectors in your index, you should call [`index.train()`](../4.embedded-lib-specifics/4.0.train-index.md). Without doing so, queries will run slower. For more details, see [Training an Encrypted Index](../4.embedded-lib-specifics/4.0.train-index.md).
