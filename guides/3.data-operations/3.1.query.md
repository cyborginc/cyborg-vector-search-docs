# Querying an Encrypted Index

Once you've added data to an encrypted index, you can query it:

```python
import cyborg_vector_search_py as cvs

# Set index location and config location beforehand...
client = cvs.Client(index_location=index_location, config_location=config_location)

# Load index
index_name = "my_index" # Index name (must exist)
index_key = b'...' # Replace with your index key
index = client.load_index(index_name=index_name, index_key=index_key)

# Example query
query_vector = [0.5, 0.9, 0.2, 0.7]
top_k = 10

# Perform query
results = index.query(query_vector=query_vector, top_k=top_k)

print(results)
# Example results (IDs and distances)
# [("id": 12, "distance": 0.01), ("id": 7, "distance": 0.04), ...]
```

For implementation details of `query`, review our API docs [here](../../reference/python/py-api.md#query) (or for C++, [here](../../reference/cpp/cpp-api.md#query)).

## Query Parameters

Encrypted queries expose a number of parameters to tune performance as desired:

- **`query_vector` or `query_vectors`**: vector or vectors to use for nearest-neighbor search. See [Batched Queries](#batched-queries) to learn more about `query_vectors`.
- **top_k**: maximum number of nearest neighbors to return. Defaults to `100`.
- **n_probes**: number of lists (clusters) to probe in search. Defaults to `1`. See [Configuring Index Types](../2.encrypted-indexes/2.3.configuring-encrypted-index.md#configuring-an-encrypted-index) for details about lists. Higher `n_probes` will yield greater recall but longer query times.
- **return_distances**: whether to return distances in result tuples. Defaults to `True`.
- **return_metadata**: (_coming in v0.9.0_) whether to return metadata for each match. Defaults to `False`. See [Metadata Filtering](./3.3.metadata-filtering.md) for more details.
- **filters**: (_coming in v0.9.0_) metadata filters to apply before vectors search. See [Metadata Filtering](./3.3.metadata-filtering.md) for more details.

## Batched Queries

Queries can be batched by passing a list of vectors to the `query` call via `query_vectors`:

```python
# Example queries
query_vector = [
    [0.5, 0.9, 0.2, 0.7],
    [0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]
]
top_k = 10

# Perform query
results = index.query(query_vectors=query_vectors, top_k=top_k)

print(results)
# Example results (IDs and distances, for each query)
# [
#   [("id": 12, "distance": 0.01), ("id": 7, "distance": 0.04), ...], # Query #1
#   [("id": 3, "distance": 0.02), ("id": 16, "distance": 0.12), ...]  # Query #2
# ]
```

## Retrieving Items Post-Query

In certain applications, such as RAG, it may be desirable to retrieve matching items after a query. This is possible via `get_item`, which retrieves and decrypts items (if they were added in `upsert`):

```python
# Example query
query_vector = [0.5, 0.9, 0.2, 0.7]
top_k = 10

# Perform query
results = index.query(query_vector=query_vector, top_k=top_k)

# Extract the item IDs from the query
result_ids = [res["id"] for res in results]

# Retrieve the items from the query results
items = index.get_items(result_ids)

# Alternatively, retrieve only the top match
item = index.get_item(results[0]["id"])
```

For implementation details of `get_item`, review our API docs [here](../../reference/python/py-api.md#get-item) (or for C++, [here](../../reference/cpp/cpp-api.md#get-item)).

## Query Performance

> [!TIP]
> For the [embedded lib](../0.overview/0.1.deployment-models.md) version of Cyborg Vector Search, queries will initially default to 'untrained' queries, which use an exhaustive search algorithm. This is fine for small datasets, but once you have more than `50,000` vectors in your index, you should call [`index.train()`](../4.embedded-lib-specifics/4.0.train-index.md). Without doing so, queries will run slower. For more details, see [Training an Encrypted Index](../4.embedded-lib-specifics/4.0.train-index.md).
