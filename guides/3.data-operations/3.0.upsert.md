# Adding Data to an Encrypted Index

Once you've created an encrypted index, you can add data to it using the `upsert` function:

```python
import cyborg_vector_search_py as cvs

# Set index location and config location beforehand...
client = cvs.Client(index_location=index_location, config_location=config_location)

# Load index
index_name = "my_index" # Index name (must exist)
index_key = b'...' # Replace with your index key
index = client.load_index(index_name=index_name, index_key=index_key)

# Example data in the format:
# [{id: int, vector: List[float])]
data = [
    {"id": 1, "vector": [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1]},
    {"id": 2, "vector": [0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2]}
]

# Upsert data
index.upsert(data)
```

The `upsert` call will perform the encrypted indexing and storage of the indexed vectors, which will then be ready for encrypted queries.

## Storing Encrypted Items

You can also store item contents in the `upsert` calls:

```python
# Example data in the format:
# [{id: int, vector: List[float], item: bytes)]
data = [
    {"id": 1, "vector": [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1], "item": b'item_contents_here...'},
    {"id": 2, "vector": [0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2], "item": b'item_contents_here...'}
]

# Upsert data with items
index.upsert(data)
```

For more details, see [Storing Encrypted Items](./3.2.storing-encrypted-items.md).

## Storing Metadata

It's also possible to store metadata in `upsert` for metadata filtering at query-time:

```python
# Example data in the format:
# [{id: int, vector: List[float], metadata: Dict)]
data = [
    {"id": 1, "vector": [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1], "metadata": {"category": "dog"}},
    {"id": 2, "vector": [0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2], "metadata": {"category": "cat"}}
]

# Upsert data with metadata
index.upsert(data)
```

For more details, see [Metadata Filtering](./3.3.metadata-filtering.md).

## Understanding Conflicts & Updates

Since Cyborg Vector Search is end-to-end encrypted, it cannot manage conflicts and updates in the way that "traditional" Vector DBs do. Since index contents can't be viewed server-side, conflicts are handled client-side. The way this works is simple: `upsert` calls on the same ID will logically "overwrite" the ID, but not via a deletion. Rather, the original entry is kept but ignored in favor of the second one during query operations.
