# Understanding Location & Storage Options

Self-hosted versions of CyborgDB operate under a BYODB (Bring Your Own Database) model. In other words, CyborgDB sits between your application and your database backing store:

This allows CyborgDB to be a drop-in addition to existing stacks, without requiring the complexity of an additional storage layer.
