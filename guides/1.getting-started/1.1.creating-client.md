# Creating a Client

## Overview

Cyborg Vector Search is broadly made up of two user-facing components:

- Client
- Encrypted Index

The Client provides an interface to initialize, create, load and list Encrypted Indexes. Encrypted Indexes, in turn, expose data-related functionality such as upserting, querying, and deleting.

## Creating the Client

To create the client, you must define the [backing store locations](../0.overview/0.2.storage-locations.md) which it will use. At minimum, you must set an `index_location` (where the index will reside) and a `config_location` (where the index metadata will reside). For example:

```python
import cyborg_vector_search_py as cvs

index_location = cvs.DBConfig(location='redis', connection_string="redis://localhost")
config_location = cvs.DBConfig(location='redis', connection_string="redis://localhost")

# Construct the Client object
client = cvs.Client(index_location=index_location, 
                            config_location=config_location)
```

Bear in mind that all contents stored in the backing stores is end-to-end encrypted, meaning that **no index contents will be stored in plaintext**. For performance reasons, you may wish to use a "fast" backing store option for `index_location`, such as Redis.

---

## Creating the Client with Item Storage

If you wish to store encrypted items in the index, you will also need to set a `item_location`:

```python
import cyborg_vector_search_py as cvs

index_location = cvs.DBConfig(location="redis", db_connection_string="redis://localhost")
config_location = cvs.DBConfig(location="redis", db_connection_string="redis://localhost")
item_location = cvs.DBConfig(location="postgres", table_name="item_table", db_connection_string="host=localhost dbname=postgres")

# Construct the Client object
client = cvs.Client(index_location=index_location, 
                            config_location=config_location,
                            item_location=item_location)
```

Item contents will be encrypted prior to being uploaded to the backing store. In most applications, these are accessed less frequently than the index, so a "slower" backing store option can be used, such as PostgreSQL.

## Setting Device Configurations

Cyborg Vector Search can be accelerated in two ways:

- CPU Multithreading (via OpenMP) -> can scale with the number of CPU cores available
- GPU Acceleration (via CUDA & cuVS) -> can increase the speed of certain operations (e.g., ingestion) by an order of magnitude.

You can control either of these with the optional `cpu_threads` and `gpu_accelerate` flags:

```python
# ... existing setup
client = cvs.Client(index_location=index_location, 
                            config_location=config_location,
                            item_location=item_location,
                            cpu_threads=4,
                            gpu_accelerate=False)
```

> [!WARNING]
> `gpu_accelerate` can only be set to `True` if running on a CUDA-enabled system with the CUDA driver installed.

By default, `cpu_threads` will use all available cores, and `gpu_accelerate` will be set to `False`.
