# Cyborg Vector Search Quickstart

> [!NOTE]
> For simplicity, all of the guides here use Python examples. For C++, please see [here](../../reference/cpp/cpp-api.md).

---

## Installation

1. Ensure Python is installed (currently `3.11` and `3.12` are supported). If your version does not satisfy the requirement, create a compatible environment:

    ```bash
    conda create -n cyborg-env python=3.11
    ```

2. Install Cyborg Vector Search:

    ```bash
    pip install cyborg_vector_search_py -i https://dl.cloudsmith.io/<token>/cyborg/cyborg-vector-search/python/simple/
    ```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You will need to replace `<token>` with the token provided by the Cyborg team for your use. Without it, you cannot install the `cyborg_vector_search_py` module.

## Cyborg Vector Search Usage

### 1. Importing Cyborg Vector Search

```python
import cyborg_vector_search_py as cvs
```

### 2. Initializing Cyborg Vector Search

Initialize the Cyborg Vector Search client with the configuration:
```python
index_location = cvs.DBConfig(location="memory")
config_location = cvs.DBConfig(location="memory")

client = cvs.Client(
    index_location=index_location,
    config_location=config_location,
    cpu_threads=10,
    gpu_accelerate=False
)
```

For more details, see [Creating a Client](./1.1.creating-client.md).

### 2. Creating an Index

Configure the index location and setup the index configuration:

```python
# Set index parameters
dimension = 128  # Adjust according to your dataset
n_lists = 4096
index_config = cvs.IndexIVFFlat(dimension, n_lists)
index_name = "test_index"
index_key = bytes([0] * 32) # Set your private key here

# Create the index
index = client.create_index(index_name, index_key, index_config)
```

For more details, see [Creating an Encrypted Index](../2.encrypted-indexes/2.1.creating-encrypted-index.md).

### 4. Upserting Vectors
Insert vectors into the index:

```python
index.upsert(ids=ids, vectors=vectors)
```

For more details, see [Upsert Data](../3.data-operations/3.0.upsert.md).

### 5. Querying the Index

Query with untrained or trained vectors, adjusting parameters as needed:

```python
top_k = 100
results = index.query(test_vectors, top_k)
```

For more details, see [Querying an Encrypted Index](../3.data-operations/3.1.query.md).
