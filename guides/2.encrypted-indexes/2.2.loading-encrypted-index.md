# Loading an Existing Encrypted Index

If you've previously created an encrypted index, you can connect to it to add, query or delete data from it. You will need to know the index's name as well as its key to do so:

```python
import cyborgdb
import secrets

# Set index location and config location beforehand...

client = cyborgdb.Client(index_location=index_location, config_location=config_location)

index_name = "my_index" # Index name (must exist)
index_key = b'...' # Replace with your index key

index = client.load_index(index_name=index_name, index_key=index_key)
```

This operation will return an `index` object referencing your existing encrypted index. Note that if either the index name or index key are incorrect, the `load_index` function will throw an error.

> [!NOTE]
> You will need to replace `index_key` with your own index encryption key. For production use, we recommend that you use an HSM or KMS to do this (see [Managing Encryption Keys](../5.security-details/5.0.managing-keys.md)).

For implementation details of `load_index`, review our API docs [here](../../reference/python/py-api.md#load-index) (or for C++, [here](../../reference/cpp/cpp-api.md#loadindex)).

## Encrypted Index Caching

For improved query performance, you can enable [encrypted index caching](../7.performance-tuning/7.1.index-caching.md).
