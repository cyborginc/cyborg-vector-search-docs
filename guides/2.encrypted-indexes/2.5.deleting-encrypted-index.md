# Deleting an Encrypted Index

To delete an encrypted index and its contents, you need to connect to the index (via `load_index`) and use the `delete_index` function:

```python
import cyborgdb

# Set index location and config location beforehand...

client = cyborgdb.Client(index_location=index_location, config_location=config_location)

index_name = "my_index" # Index name (must exist)
index_key = b'...' # Replace with your index key

index = client.load_index(index_name=index_name, index_key=index_key)

# Delete index (proceed with caution)
index.delete_index()
```

> [!WARNING]
> Deleting an index will delete all of its contents, including vectors, IDs and item contents. This action is irreversible. Proceed with caution.

For implementation details of `delete_index`, review our API docs [here](../../reference/python/py-api.md#delete-index) (or for C++, [here](../../reference/cpp/cpp-api.md#deleteindex)).
