# Training an Encrypted Index

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This functionality is only present in the [embedded library](../0.overview/0.1.deployment-models.md#1-embedded-library) version of Cyborg Vector Search.
> In other versions (microservice, serverless), it is automatically called once enough vector embeddings have been indexed.

Cyborg Vector Search uses `IVF*` index types, which leverage clustering algorithms to segment the index into smaller sections for efficient querying. These clustering algorithms must be trained on the specific data being indexed in order to adequately represent that data.

## Training the Encrypted Index

In the [embedded library](../0.overview/0.1.deployment-models.md#1-embedded-library) version of Cyborg Vector Search, this training must be explicitly called once enough vectors have been added:

```python
# Load existing index with already-added vectors
index_name = "my_index" # Index name (must exist)
index_key = b'...' # Replace with your index key
index = client.load_index(index_name=index_name, index_key=index_key)

# Train index
index.train()
```

> [!NOTE]
> You must have at least `2 * n_lists` number of vectors in the index (ingested via `upsert`) before you can call `train`.

For implementation details of `train`, review our API docs [here](../../reference/python/py-api.md#train) (or for C++, [here](../../reference/cpp/cpp-api.md#train)).

## Training Parameters

Parameters are available to customize the training process:

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---------------|--------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `batch_size` | `int` | `0` | _(Optional)_ Size of each batch for training. `0` auto-selects the batch size. |
| `max_iters` | `int` | `0` | _(Optional)_ Maximum number of iterations for training. `0` auto-selects the iteration count. |
| `tolerance` | `float`| `1e-6` | _(Optional)_ Convergence tolerance for training. |
| `max_memory` | `int` | `0` | _(Optional)_ Maximum memory usage in MB during training. `0` imposes no limit. |

## Warnings with Large Untrained Queries

While training is technically optional (you can use Cyborg Vector Search without ever calling `train`), it is recommended that you do so once you have a large number of vectors in the index (e.g., `> 50,000`). If you don't, and you call `query`, you will see a warning in the console, stating:

```
Warning: querying untrained index with more than 50000 indexed vectors.
```
