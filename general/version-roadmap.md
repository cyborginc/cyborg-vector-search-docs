# Cyborg Vector Search - Versions & Release Roadmap

After months of testing and pilot deployments, we are starting to release Cyborg Vector Search `v0.7.0` to customers for early access. `v0.7.x` only comprises the "embedded lib" which is a Python or C++ module that runs directly on your hardware and connects to the backing store of choice.
