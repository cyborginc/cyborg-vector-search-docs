# Cyborg Vector Search Docs

**Cyborg Vector Search** is the first Confidential Vector DB:

- Introduces a novel architecture to keep confidential inference data secure through zero-trust design.
- Keeps vector embeddings end-to-end encrypted throughout their lifecycle (including at search time).
- Exposes a familiar API, making it easy to migrate from traditional Vector DBs.
- Provides high-performance indexing and retrieval which can be [GPU-accelerated with CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/bringing-confidentiality-to-vector-search-with-cyborg-and-nvidia-cuvs/).
